# jira-tools
If you're like me, you forget (on a daily basis) to move your JIRA tickets around. I wrote this script to not only remind myself to do so, but to embed it into my already command-line-heavy workflow.

## Note
This is **super** not production ready. It's currently pretty tightly coupled with my use case, but I plan to (very) slowly fix that.
